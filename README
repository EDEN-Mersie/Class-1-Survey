# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository includes the Class 1 survey dataset and R markdown code used to analyze it. The project is part of an exercise to practice working with real-world data in R markdown.

## Files Included
- `class1_survey.csv`: Cleaned version of the Class 1 survey dataset
- `analysis_code eden.Rmd`: R script used to summarize and visualize the data
- `README.md`: This file

## What the Code Does
- Reads in the survey dataset
- Performs basic data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, filtering)
- Creates summary statistics (e.g., age, gender, responses)
-Build a table of software preference among cat lovers

## Load Data
•	Reads in the raw Class 1 survey dataset directly from GitHub.
•	Uses dim() to quickly check the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

## Rename Columns
•	Applies standardized names to all the variables.
•	Renaming makes later analysis easier.

## Clean and Summarize bday and bmonth 
Keeps the raw versions of bday and bmonth while creating cleaned numeric versions.
Converts values into numbers for consistent analysis.
calculate the median bday and bmonth

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `analysis_code.Rmd` in RStudio
3. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are saved
4. Run the script
